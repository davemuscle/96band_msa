*Migrated to Git on February 20th, 2022. Updated web page on July 5th, 2020. Original release in
April 2020.*

This project converts your audio into a frequency spectrum and displays it on a VGA monitor in
real-time. The spectrum is mapped to all 96 half-notes in the first eight octaves, and is tuned to
A4 (440 Hz). It provides a visible output of 1920x1080 pixels at 60FPS, including multiple color
palette choices. There is also a choice between using an onboard microphone with auto gain control,
or a line-level input output pair.
